                (Friday).</a></p><br>
        <p><strong>Independence Day </strong>is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India
            commemorating the nation's
            independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the Indian
            Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into
            effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the
            Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced
            the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India
            attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil
            disobedience.<br>Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which British India was divided
            along religious lines into the Dominions of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent
            riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence. On 15
            August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the
            Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister
            customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the nation.[1] The entire event is broadcast by
            Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah
            Khan. Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural
            events. It is a national holiday.</p><br>

        <p>European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the late 17th century. Through
            overwhelming military strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established
            themselves as the dominant force by the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government
            of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic
            society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in
            1885. The period after World War I was marked by colonial reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford
            Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian
            activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of
            non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
            <br>
            During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the
            resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in
            World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the
            All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation
            was tempered by the bloody partition of colonial India into India and Pakistan.

        <p>At the 1929 session of the Indian National Congress, the Purna Swaraj declaration, or "Declaration of the
            Independence of India" was promulgated, and 26 January was declared as Independence Day in 1930. The
            Congress called on people to pledge themselves to civil disobedience and "to carry out the Congress
            instructions issued from time to time" until India attained complete independence. Celebration of such an
            Independence Day was envisioned to stoke nationalistic fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the
            British government to consider granting independence.The Congress observed 26 January as the
            Independence Day between 1930 and 1946. The celebration was marked by meetings where the attendants
            took the "pledge of independence". Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such
            meetings were peaceful, solemn, and "without any speeches or exhortation". Gandhi envisaged that besides
            the meetings, the day would be spent " ... in doing some constructive work, whether it is spinning, or
            service of 'untouchables,' or reunion of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these
            together".Following actual independence in 1947, the Constitution of India came into effect on and from
            26 January 1950; since then 26 January is celebrated as Republic Day.</p><br>
